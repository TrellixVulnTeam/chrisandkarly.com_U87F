            <h1>A boy from Connecticut<br /> and a girl from Philly.</h1>

                And believe it or not, it all started in New York City.

            <h4 class="questrial">
                I had my eye on Karly for a while. I distinctly remember telling my best friend about "the cute social media girl at work," but I didn't know just quite how to make a move without messing things up. I tried time and time again to invite her out to happy hours with coworkers, but Karly was quite the social butterfly - always a yoga class or a conert to get to. With the help of colleague, I finally got her to join me one night. After a few whikey mules and some great conversation, we both realized we were starving! On that cold winter night - our search for food landed the two of us at none other than the Meatball shop - the perfect warm meal to end what would then be known as our first date. 
            </h4>
            <h4 class="questrial">
                Since then, it's been nothing short of adventure. Whether Jackson Hole, Utah, Portland, or the Jersey Shore - we can't stay still for long. We're excited to find a place we can make our own home, and we can't wait to take off on our next adventure.

            <h4 class="questrial">
                It started with a Whisky Mule. He finally convinced me to get drinks after work. I always had something going on, but happened to be free this time, and he was pretty persistent. We were talking about Mules and told Chris he could try mine. Our hands touched and I thought, "he could be the one for me". Cheesy and gross—I know and I'm sorry, but that's what happened. Fast forward a few weeks (though Chris apparently thinks it was the same night—it was not). We were out again and it was freezing out. Chris noticed I was chattering, and put his coat around me to keep me warm. We ended up in the Lower East Side at the Meatball Shop. Amongst meatballs, wine and pasta we talked and laughed all night long. That weekend, Chris came over and spent the afternoon helping me cook for a Hanukkah dinner I was having with friends. After dinner, as we were cleaning up and putting dishes in the dishwasher, Chris gave me a kiss. It was the beginning of our adventure together.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="questrial">From then on, we’ve eaten many a meatballs, cooked Hanukkah and Christmas dinners, had more Mules and traveled across the country together. Can’t wait to see what is next.
